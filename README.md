# Group Project UIX: Company Site Round Two

As a team, we Tasteful Partridges have created a website for teenage users to gain more control of their schedule and to prioritize their tasks. This is a class project for our Cohort 24 course with the Nashville Software School

## How to Use

We expect that there will more than likely be two main paths of usage for the user. 

The user will land on the index page. They can browse through the options of pages through either the navigation bar or the footer. From there, the user can browse through all of the website pages. The 'About Us' page will contain information regarding the company and the development team, the 'Products' page will feature all eight of the products that the company has to offer, the 'Product Detail' page will go into greater detail regarding our feature product, the 'Contact' page will show the user our location and all contact information, and the final page is the 'Shopping Cart' page. This page will feature the product that the user has selected to purchase. From there, they can select the country to ship the product to or to navigate to another page.


The other path the user may take is that they land on the product detail page after specifically searching for this product. From there, the user can browse other pages or proceed to their shopping cart and checkout.
